Description: Evidence maps (including systematic maps and evidence and gap maps) 
    produce databases of studies that include multiple categorical 'coding' variables 
    that describe the evidence base. This package allows review authors to convert an
    evidence map database into a 'bubble evidence map' or a 'grid' plot, of a heat map 
    (i.e. a matrix of two categorical variables) that can contain bubbles coloured and 
    sized according to additional categorical and continuous variables, or a 
    traditional grid-style heat map if no third categorical variable is supplied.
