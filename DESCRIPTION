Description: Evidence maps (including systematic maps and evidence and gap maps) 
    produce databases of studies that include multiple categorical 'coding' variables 
    that describe the evidence base. This package allows review authors to convert an
    evidence map database into a 'bubble evidence map', of a heat map (i.e. a matrix 
    of two categorical variables) that contains bubbles coloured and sized according 
    to additional categorical and continuous variables.
